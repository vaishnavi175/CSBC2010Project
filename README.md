Voting Smart Contract

This is a smart contract for a voting system that uses an off-chain voting roll call mechanism. The contract allows registered voters to cast a vote for a selected candidate, and ensures that each voter can only cast one vote. The contract also provides a method to retrieve the list of registered voters.
High-level design

The contract uses a mapping to keep track of registered voters and their voting status. When a voter registers, their address is added to the mapping with the hasVoted status set to false. When a voter casts a vote, their hasVoted status is updated to true and their vote is recorded in another mapping.

To ensure that each voter can only cast one vote, the contract checks if the hasVoted status is false before allowing a vote to be cast. If a voter tries to cast a vote again, the contract will revert with an error message.

The contract uses an off-chain voting roll call mechanism, meaning that voters are registered off-chain and their addresses are added to the contract by the contract owner.
Implementation details

The contract is implemented in Solidity version 0.8.9. It includes the following functions:
registerVoter(address voterAddress) public

Registers a new voter with the given address. Can only be called by the contract owner.
castVote(uint256 voteSelection) public

Allows a registered voter to cast a vote for a selected candidate. The voteSelection parameter should be an integer representing the candidate selection. Can only be called by a registered voter who has not already cast a vote.
getRegisteredVoters() public view returns (address[] memory)

Returns an array of addresses representing the registered voters.
getRegisteredVotersCount() public view returns (uint256)

Returns the number of registered voters.

The contract includes appropriate error handling to prevent common attack vectors, such as reentrancy attacks, by following best practices.
Gas cost optimizations

The contract has been optimized for gas costs, which is an important consideration when deploying smart contracts. The use of mappings and arrays allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data, while the use of modifiers reduces code duplication and simplifies contract logic.
Security considerations

Security is a critical consideration when deploying smart contracts, as they are public and immutable once deployed. The contract has been designed with security in mind and includes various security features and best practices, such as:

    The use of access modifiers to restrict access to certain functions
    Appropriate error handling to prevent common attack vectors
    The use of a minimalistic design to reduce attack surface and improve security
    Careful consideration of gas costs to prevent vulnerabilities related to gas limits

Attacks Considered and Prevention Measures:

    Double Voting: This occurs when a voter tries to cast their vote more than once. To prevent this, the smart contract checks if the voter has already voted before registering the vote.
    Invalid Vote Selection: This occurs when a voter tries to cast a vote for an invalid candidate or selection. The smart contract prevents this by checking that the selection is within the valid range of options.
    Voter Registration from Unauthorized Address: This occurs when a person who is not the contract owner tries to register a voter. The smart contract prevents this by allowing only the contract owner to call the registerVoter function.
    Unauthorized Voter: This occurs when a person who is not registered tries to cast their vote. The smart contract prevents this by checking that the voter is registered before allowing them to cast their vote.

Optimization and Gas Cost:

    To optimize the gas cost of the smart contract, we used view and pure functions wherever possible. These functions do not modify the state of the contract and therefore do not require any gas to be spent.
    Additionally, we used the constant keyword for any variables that do not change after deployment. This saves gas by not requiring the variable to be stored on the blockchain.
    To ensure that the contract does not exceed the gas limit, we tested the contract using a local blockchain and monitored the gas usage of each function. We then adjusted the code to optimize the gas usage while maintaining the desired functionality. We also used Truffle's built-in gas profiler to identify areas where gas usage could be optimized.

Overall, this voting smart contract provides a secure and efficient way to conduct a voting process using an off-chain voting roll call mechanism. It has been designed with security and gas cost optimizations in mind, and includes appropriate error handling to prevent common attack vectors.
